🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

Internet connection (for live URL analysis)

Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-detector.git
cd phishing-detector

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run a quick test
python phishing_detector.py -u "https://example.com"
Basic Usage
Analyze a URL:

bash
python phishing_detector.py -u "https://paypal-verify.com/login"
Analyze an email (from file):

bash
python phishing_detector.py -e suspicious_email.txt -s "security@paypal.com"
Save report to file:

bash
python phishing_detector.py -u "https://suspicious-link.com" -o report.txt
📖 Detailed Usage Examples
Example 1: URL Analysis
python
from phishing_detector import PhishingDetector

detector = PhishingDetector()
result = detector.analyze_url("https://apple-verification.com/account/secure")

print(f"Risk Level: {result['risk_level']}")
print(f"Risk Score: {result['risk_score']}/100")
for indicator in result['indicators']:
    print(f"⚠ {indicator}")
Output:

text
Risk Level: CRITICAL
Risk Score: 75/100
⚠ Potential apple impersonation
⚠ Suspicious TLD: .com (not matching official domain)
⚠ No HTTPS encryption
Example 2: Email Analysis
python
email_content = """
URGENT: Your account has been locked!
Dear User,
Please verify your PayPal account immediately.
Click here: https://paypa1-secure.com/login
"""

result = detector.analyze_email(email_content, "noreply@paypal-security.com")
report = detector.generate_report(result)
print(report)
🏗️ Architecture
Detection Methods
Heuristic Analysis: Pattern matching for known phishing indicators

Reputation Checking: Domain age, SSL certificates, and TLD analysis

Behavioral Analysis: Redirect patterns and URL structure

Content Analysis: Keyword scanning and linguistic patterns

Risk Scoring System
Indicator Type	Risk Points
Brand Impersonation	25-30
Invalid SSL	25
Suspicious TLD	20
IP Address URL	20
@ Symbol in URL	20
No HTTPS	20
Multiple Redirects	15
URL Shortener	15
Excessive Subdomains	15
Phishing Keywords	10-20
Risk Level Classification
0-19: LOW - Likely safe

20-39: MEDIUM - Exercise caution

40-59: HIGH - High risk of phishing

60+: CRITICAL - Almost certainly phishing

🔧 Advanced Configuration
Customize Detection Parameters
python
detector = PhishingDetector()

# Add custom suspicious TLDs
detector.suspicious_tlds.extend(['.free', '.download', '.gift'])

# Add brand names to monitor
detector.brand_names.extend(['yourcompany', 'yourbank'])

# Customize phishing keywords
detector.phishing_keywords += ['immediate action required', 'account compromise']
Integration with External Services
python
# Example: Integration with VirusTotal API
def enhance_with_virustotal(url, api_key):
    import requests
    vt_result = requests.get(f'https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/urls/{url}', 
                             headers={'x-apikey': api_key})
    # Integrate results with phishing analysis
    return vt_result.json()
📊 Output Formats
JSON Output
bash
python phishing_detector.py -u "https://test.com" --format json
HTML Report
python
# Generate HTML report (example extension)
detector.generate_html_report(result, "report.html")
CSV Export
python
# Export multiple analyses to CSV
detector.export_to_csv([result1, result2, result3], "analyses.csv")
